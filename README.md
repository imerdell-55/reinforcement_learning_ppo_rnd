# PPO-RND

Simple code to demonstrate Reinforcement Learning using Proximal Policy Optimization and Random Network Distillation

## Getting Started

This project is using Pytorch for Deep Learning Framework and Gym for Reinforcement Learning Environment.  
Although it's not required, but i recommend run this project on a PC with GPU and 8 GB Ram

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed Pytorch and Gym.  
- Click [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install pytorch  
- Click [here](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) to install gym

### Installing

Just clone this project into your work folder

```
git clone https://github.com/wisnunugroho21/reinforcement_learning_ppo_rnd.git
```

## Running the project

After you clone the project, enter the folder and run following script in cmd/terminal :

```
python rl_ppo_rnd_cartpole_pytorch.py
```

## Future development

I really want to adapt this code to Tensorflow  
But i think it's best to wait for Tensorflow 2.0 to be fully release
